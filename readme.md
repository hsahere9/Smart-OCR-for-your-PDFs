# Project Title

This project is a simple yet powerful PDF OCR tool that extracts text from scanned PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It is designed for:

Students, researchers, and professionals who need to convert image-based PDFs into searchable, editable text.

Anyone looking to search for specific words or phrases inside scanned PDFs.

With just two Python scripts, users can extract text and instantly search through the content â€” making scanned documents far more usable.

## Installation

git clone the repositary 
    

    cd pdf-ocr

    Step 1: Extract Text from PDFs
    Run the OCR extraction script:


    python ocr_extract.py
    You'll be prompted to select one or more PDF files.
    The script will process each file and extract text using OCR.

    Extracted text files will be saved automatically.

    step 2: Search for a Word
    After extraction is complete, run the search script:


    python search_word.py
    Enter the word or phrase you want to search.

    The script will search through the extracted text and show matching results.
## Motivation

Why This Project?
Existing tools often misplace OCR text â€” breaking copy/paste.

Poor support for accents and multilingual characters.

Image quality was altered or degraded.

Outputs were too large or not valid PDFs.

None supported proper PDF/A for long-term storage.

So I built a tool that just works â€” clean, fast, and reliable
